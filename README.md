# interview-prep

Notes based on my experience so far.

## General advice

Interviewing is hard and being rejected over and over again could be discouraging and hurtful.

Remember: do not take it personal, you are not your job.

Next time you will get it, don't give up, Tarnished.

### Resume

Consult someone experienced to help you write your resume.

### Python


### SQL

[PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/) to brush up basics.

Practice:

2. [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/).
3. [hackerrank.com](hackerrank.com).

### Algorithms & Data Structures

Whether you like it or not leetcode-like interviews are industry standard.

Use 'Easy' problems to warm-up, but don't waste too much on of a time on them.
Focus on 'Medium' level problems as most interviews consist of them.
If you have free time you can try to solve 'Hard' problems but they are rarely asked on real interviews.

If get stuck on a problem more than 30-60 minutes, just look up a solution, learn it and move on.
Do not waste time!

### Behavioral interview

In any job it's important to have solid 'hard' skills and know what you are doing,
but remember that companies first and foremost are hiring people.
I'd prefer to work with someone I like and respect than with someone toxic-ass genius with zero social skills.

### Companies and people I wouldn't work with

### How to approach work tasks and communication within team 

### Signs that your team lead is not good

### How do I know when it's time to leave?
